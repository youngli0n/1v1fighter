"""Object Registration - Import all object types to register them"""

# Import all object types - this triggers their registration
import speed_boost_object  # Registers 'speed_boost'
import speed_buff_object  # Registers 'speed_buff'

# Add more object imports here as you create them:
# import pierce_object  # Would register 'pierce'
# import shield_object  # Would register 'shield'
